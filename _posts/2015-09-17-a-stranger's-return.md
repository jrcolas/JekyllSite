## A Stranger's Return

It has been a long time hasn't it? Almost as if I totally abandoned my own project. Well, this isn't the case at all and it is not my fault. I'll just leave it at that.

Since my last post, school has been back in session, almost leaving me no time to even eat (I eat; thanks for your concerns).

Now I have some things I want to do and I've decided to use my website to motivate me. Or force me. One of them.

I'm currently learning java programming in school. I've had some programming background (hence..ahem..my website..ahem..) so it doesn't seem too hard to get a hang of. I will go ahead and start developing an app for this website. It'll be fun.

I've developed a working app for Android before but I got stuck on the way and I haven't figured out the issue yet. I believe I'll definitely finish it soon enough. I'm looking to complete the application for the website within the month, which is already half way gone. But with dedication, I should be fine.

With everything I have going on right now, it'll be quite the challenge to manage my time and balance everything, but that is a challenge I'm willing to face.

In other news, while writing this, I just got a free phone!

Leave your comments down below and let me know what you think.

Take care everyone!
